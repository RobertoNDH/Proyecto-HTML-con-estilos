## 🧠 Technical Achievements and Learning

Building this project allowed me to refine my skills in Fullstack development and clean code practices:

- **Semantic HTML5 Mastery**: I moved beyond generic containers to use semantic tags such as header, nav, main, section, and article. This approach improves search engine optimization (SEO) and ensures full accessibility for screen readers.
- **Complex Navigation Logic**: I implemented a multi-level navigation bar with functional submenus for "Who we are" and "Join us" sections, ensuring a smooth user journey.
- **Responsive Grid Architecture**: I utilized CSS Grid to create an organized card system for the "Courses" and "Blog" sections, allowing the layout to adapt seamlessly to various screen dimensions.
- **Performance Optimization**: Use of high-efficiency .avif image formats to ensure fast loading times without compromising visual quality, adhering to modern performance benchmarks.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For semantic structure and document integrity.
- **CSS3**: Powering the responsive layout through Grid and Flexbox systems.
- **Clean Code Principles**: Ensuring the codebase is maintainable and logically organized.
